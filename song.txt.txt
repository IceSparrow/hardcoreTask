I fell for your magic
I tasted your skin
And though this is tragic
At least I found the end
I witness your madness
You shed light on my sins
And if we share in this sadness
Then where have you been?

I know you're not in love
Like you used to be
Guess I'm not the one
Like you used to think
So you just run
I know that I'm stuck
In this misery
Guess I'm not enough
Like you used to think
So I'll just run
